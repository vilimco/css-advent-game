# css-advent-game
Here's a simple game I made for a ZG SCSS Meetup of December, 2019th. 

Best experience if played in full screen mode (without the URL bar). 🎅🏻

You can play it on this [DEMO LINK](http://css-advent-game.asynclabs.co/).

Known problems:
- can't block the game end while only playing with keyboard
- not responsive

TODO:
- add proper README.md
- add more examples
